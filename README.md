##  Project Description

The **Wedding Vendor Management System** is an all-in-one platform designed to make wedding planning simple, transparent, and efficient. It allows customers to discover, compare, and book vendors across categories like catering, decoration, venues, and photography, all from a single dashboard. Vendors can register, showcase their services, and manage inquiries, while administrators oversee the entire ecosystem with tools to manage users, listings, and platform activity. By centralizing everything, the system reduces the stress of vendor searches, miscommunication, and scattered processes that couples typically face.

What makes this platform stand out is its **role-based approach**, offering tailored dashboards and features for customers, vendors, and admins. Customers save time with organized vendor discovery and booking, vendors gain visibility and growth opportunities through direct access to clients, and admins maintain quality and security across the system. In essence, it bridges the gap between couples planning their big day and vendors offering their services, creating a smoother, more reliable, and transparent wedding planning experience for everyone involved.
